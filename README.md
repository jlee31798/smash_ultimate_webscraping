# smash_ultimate_webscraping
Anyone who is close to me would know that I became a big fan of the game Smash Ultimate ever since quarantine started. I was very drawn to the excitement from reading your opponent's mind while landing cool combos. I eventually realized that maybe I could combine this interest for the game with my own career interest in data as well. So I decided to go on UltimateFrameData.com to see if I could do something with all of the characters' frame data.

Note that this is still a work in progress! Ideally the project would be split into 4 sections: Webscraping with Selenium, Data Cleaning with Pandas, Create a MySQL Database, and Tableau Visualizations.
